										John 8:36 NKJV</h2>
										<p>This quotation from John 8:36, was the foundational scripture of the establishment of Great Redemption Ministries Inc. in 2006. The name "Great Redemption Ministries" was therefore brought about as an inspiration from a pastor when Mr. Andrews Frimpong received the calling to establish the church. </p>

<br>
<strong>Statement of Basic Beliefs</strong><br>

We affirm the Holy Bible as the inspired Word of God and the basis for our belief.

We voluntarily band ourselves together as a body of baptized believers in Jesus Christ personally committed to sharing the good news of salvation to lost mankind.<br>
<br>
<strong>​Church Covenant</strong>
<br>
Having been led as we believe by the Spirit of God to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior and, on the profession of our faith, having been baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, we do now in the presence of God and this assembly most solemnly and joyfully enter into covenant with one another as one body in Christ, Jesus Christ as the head of the church and the Pastors as the under Shepherds.
<br>

We engage, therefore, by the aid of the Holy Spirit to walk together in Christian love; to strive for the advancement of this church in knowledge, holiness, and comfort; to promote its prosperity and spirituality; to sustain its worship, ordinances, doctrines, and discipline; to contribute cheerfully and regularly to the support of the ministry, the expenses of the church, and the relief of the poor, and the spread of the gospel throughout all nations.
<br>

We also engage to maintain family and secret devotions; to religiously educate our children; to seek the salvation of our kindred and acquaintances; to walk circumspectly in the world; to be just in our dealings, faithful in our engagements, and exemplary in our deportment; to avoid all tattling, backbiting, and excessive anger; to abstain from the sale of and use of intoxicating drinks as a beverage; to use our influence to combat the abuse of drugs and alcohol and the spread of pornography; and to be zealous in our efforts to advance the kingdom of our Savior.
<br>

We further engage to watch over one another in brotherly love; to remember one another in prayer; to aid one another in sickness and distress; to cultivate Christian sympathy in feeling and Christian courtesy in speech; to be slow to take offense, but always ready for reconciliation and mindful of the rules of our Savior to secure it without delay.
<br>

We moreover engage that when we move from this place we will as soon as possible unite with some other church where we can carry out the spirit of this covenant and the principles of God's Word.
<br>
​
</br>
<strong>Doctrinal Statement</strong><br>

As Ministers and Christian workers joined together for voluntary and co-operative fellowship and service in Great Redemption Ministries, we have taken in hand to set forth in order, a declaration of those things which are most surely believed of among us (Luke1:1). Praying that there be no harmful or divisive and peace and harmony of the Church, and that we may be all of the same mind judgment, speaking the same things (1 Corinthians 1:10, Acts 2:42), in love with one voice glorify God, edify His people and give Christian witness to the world.
<br>
</br>
<strong>SCRIPTURES</strong>
<br>
The Bible is the inspired word of God, the product of holy men of old who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Ghost (2 Peter 1:21). The New Covenant as recorded in the New Testament, we accept as our infallible guide in matters pertaining to conduct and doctrine (1 Timothy 3:15-17). "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God is profitable, for "reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; That the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works." Also see (1 Peter 2:1-2)
<br>
<br>
<strong>THE GODHEAD</strong><br>
Our God is one, but manifested in three personalities, the Father, the Word and the Holy Spirit (1 John 5:7). God, the Father is greater than all (John 14:28) the Source and the Begetter of the Word (John 1:14, John 16:28), "No man hath seen God at any time, the only Begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him" (John 1:18). The Son, is the Word, flesh covered, the One Begotten, and has existed with the Father from the beginning (John 1:1, 1:14, 1:18), being co-equal with God (Philippians 2:6). The Holy Spirit proceeds forth from God the Father, (John 14:26, John 15:26), and is eternal (John 14:16), Being promised by Christ from the Father to all fully cleansed believers (John 14: 16, 17)
<br>
<br>
<strong>MAN, HIS FALL AND REDEMPTION</strong><br>

Man a created being, made in the likeness and image of God (Genesis 1:26-27, but through Adam's transgression and fall, sin has entered into the world (Romans 5:12), "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23), "As it is written, there is none righteous, no not one: (Romans 3:10). Jesus Christ, the Son of God was manifested to undo the works of the Devil, and gave His life and shed His blood to redeem and restore man back to God (1 John 3:8). Salvation is the gift of God to man, separate from the works and the law, and is made operative by Grace through Faith in Jesus Christ, acceptable to God (Ephesians 2:8).
<br>
<br>
<strong>NEW BIRTH AND ETERNAL</strong><br>

Man's first step toward salvation is a godly sorrow that worketh repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10). The new birth is necessary to all men (John 3:3-8), and when fulfilled produces eternal life with God (1 John 5:12). We believe that eternal life with God in Heaven is the reward of the finally righteous (Matthew. 24:13), (Mark 13:13), and that everlasting banishment from the presence of the Lord, an unending torture in Hell is the fate of the persistently wicked (Matthew 2-46; Psalm 9:17, and Revelation 21:7-8). We believe there is salvation in no other name than the name of JESUS. Neither is there in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12).

​<br>
<br>

<strong>SANCTIFICATION</strong><br>

Sanctification leads to Holiness (Romans 6:22). "Follow peace with all men, and Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord (Hebrews 12:14). We believe in the Doctrine of Sanctification as a definite yet progressive work of grace, commencing at the time of regeneration and continuing until the consummation of Salvation (1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Peter 3:18; Philippians 3:23-24, and l Corinthians 1:30)
<br>
<br>
​

<strong>BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND FIRE</strong><br>

The Baptism of the Holy Spirit and Fire (Matthew 3:11), is a gift from God as promised through the Lord, Jesus Christ (John 14:16; Acts 1: 4-5), to all fully cleansed believers in this dispensation, and is received subsequently to the new birth (John l4:17; Acts 1:8; Acts 2:4; Acts 2:39). He is accompanied with the speaking in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance, as the initial physical sign and evidence (Acts 2:4; Acts 10:44-45-46)
<br>
​</br>

<strong>THE CHURCH</strong><br>

The true Church is the body of Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 12:1-10), Christ being the Head (Colossians 2:19). Its earthly constituents, are men and women, born of the Spirit, living Holy lives, striving to do the will of God. To the Church is delegated the various gifts and offices of the Holy Ghost (1 Corinthians 12:1-10), necessary for the successful fulfillment of Christ's great commission to the Church as given to the disciples in (Matthew 28:19 and Mark 16:15-20).
<br>
<br>
​<strong>WATER BAPTISM</strong><br>

Baptism in water by immersion, and is a direct commandment of our Lord (Matthew 28:19), and is for believers only (Acts 2:41, Acts 8:37). Baptism is the answer of a good conscience toward God, the ordinance is a symbol of the Christian identification with Christ in his death, burial and resurrection (1 Peter 3:21; Romans 6:4-5).
The following is the formula for Water Baptism, "On the confession of your faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and by His authority, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. (Matthew 28:19).
<br>
​<br>
<strong>LORD'S SUPPER AND FEET-WASHING</strong><br>

The ordinance of the Lord's Supper is a commandment of our Savior; and, being a memorial of His death, is strictly limited to Christian believers (1 Corinthians 11:24-30). We believe in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper among all of God's people. We believe that feet washing should follow the Lord’s Supper (John 13:1-18). The Lord said in John 13:14, "ye also ought to wash one another's feet." We believe by doing this command that we shall keep ourselves humble before our Lord.
<br>
<br>
<strong>DIVINE HEALING</strong><br>

Healing is for the physical ills of the human body and is wrought by the power of God through the prayer of faith, and the laying on of hands (Mark 16:18; James 5:14-15) and is provided for in the atonement of Christ, and is the privilege of everyone that will accept it (Luke 5:15).
<br>
<br>
<strong>MEMBERSHIP</strong><br>

And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. (Acts 2:47). We believe there are seven benefits of participation in the local church: instruction- continued steadfastness in the apostles' doctrine fellowship- “and fellowship”; observance of the ordinances -"breaking of bread"; corporate prayer- “prayers”; effective outreach- "fear came upon every soul" common cause- "had all things common and mutual assistance- "parted them to all men, as every man had need." In addition to these, four other benefits of participation in the local church are clear; worship; (Acts 20:7); discipline; (Matthew 18: 15-17, 2 Corinthians 13: 1-10) pastoral oversight (1 Peter 5:1-3); and obedience to God's command (Heb. 10:25).
<br>
<br>

<strong>MINISTRY</strong><br>

God through the Holy Ghost, definitely calls such as He desires to serve as evangelists, pastors, and teachers (Ephesians 4:11), and qualifies the ones called, with power, talents, wisdom and gifts pertaining to that office or offices (1 Corinthians 12:28). "Let every man in the same calling wherein he was called" (1 Corinthians 7:20). We pray that our ministers will preach the whole Word of God, not taking away or adding to the Word of God. (Revelations 22:18-19).
<br>
<br>

<strong>WOMEN MINISTERS</strong><br>

The gifts and callings of God are without repentance, and the Holy Ghost divideth upon each as He wills. "In the last days our sons and daughters shall prophecy (preach) (Joel 2:28-29: Act 8: 17-18). When called of God and anointed by the Holy Spirit, our women shall have the freedom to serve in the ministry as they are led by the Spirit (Acts 2:18).
<br>
<br>
​

<strong>TITHES</strong>
<br>

"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me, but ye say, wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings" (Malachi 3:8). We believe that all Christians (including ministers) should pay Tithes into the storehouse. (Malachi 3:10-11). We also believe that the church body should pay all of their tithes into the church where they are getting their Spiritual food.
<br>
<br>

<strong>RESURRECTION OF THE SAINTS</strong><br>

We believe in the Pre-Millennial coming of our Lord in the clouds, to catch away His Bride. The angel said, “This same Jesus shall so come in like manner.” (Acts 1:11) When He comes, "The dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, (1 Thessalonians. 4:16-17). Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready," (Revelation 19:7). Following the tribulation, the Lord shall return to earth as King of kings, and Lord of lords, and together with His saints, who shall be kings and priests, He shall reign a thousand years. (Revelation 20:6).
<br>
<br>
​

<strong>FINAL JUDGEMENT</strong><br>

We believe in the great white throne judgment of all. "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works" (Revelation 20:12)," and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of Fire. This is the second death" (Revelation 20:13-14). The lake of fire is literal and eternal. "And before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” Then shall He say unto them on the left hand, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting prepared for the devil and his angels.” (Matthew 25:32, 33, 34, and 41).
